Winrate - (player wr/highest wr player)*10
SQL::

SELECT (total_wins/total_games)/c.MaxWinrate * 10 as w_score, summoner_name FROM qustoms.summoner d
INNER JOIN(
SELECT MAX(a.winrate) as MaxWinrate, a.MaxTotalGames FROM qustoms.summoner

Total games - multiplier (player played/most played)*10
SQL ::

SELECT total_games/a.MaxTotalGames *10 as GameScore, summoner_name from qustoms.summoner b
INNER JOIN(
SELECT MAX(total_games) as MaxTotalGames from qustoms.summoner) a
WHERE total_games > a.MaxTotalGames/5;

champ pool - (player champ #/most # of champs played)*10
SQL::

SELECT ChampScore, f.summoner_id from qustoms.summoner_match g
INNER JOIN (
SELECT (count(distinct champion_id))/e.LargestChampPool * 10 as ChampScore, count(summoner_id) as TotalGames, summoner_id, e.MaxTotalGames2 as MaxTotalGames2 FROM qustoms.summoner_match

role diversity - (player diverse score/most diverse score)
	diversity score: 
	lowest + highest variance / lowest variance + player variance * 10
SQL::


kda - (player kda/highest kda) * 5
SQL::
SELECT ((total_kills+total_assists)/total_deaths)/MaxKDA * 10 as KDAScore, summoner_name, id from qustoms.summoner d
INNER JOIN (
SELECT MAX(KDA) as MaxKDA, MaxTotalGames as MaxTotalGames from qustoms.summoner
INNER JOIN(

INNER JOIN(
SELECT MAX(total_games) as MaxTotalGames from qustoms.summoner ) a
WHERE total_games > a.MaxTotalGames/5 ) b ) c
WHERE total_games > c.MaxTotalGames/5;

need at least 1/5 of the top players games for your stats to be considered highest and get your own score. if not, you get the lowest legit player's score minus 0.1

max score = 50
